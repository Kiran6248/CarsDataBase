### Project Barriers and solution
1. First project barrier was to show Â£ symbol on the app, as after displaying this the Add and Update functions showed error. 
    The SubString() method is used for the RentalPerDay argument to handle this.
2. The search function was not working for enhine size, one error handler is added to handle that.
3. The data display in the default datatable was not according to the project requirement, so DataTableCellAlignment is used to manage that.
